### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Samit

I am a systems engineer from the Central University of Colombia. I currently work for a bank, my job is the administration and support of all the bank's apps. I am studying a Data Scientist course at Platzi (Study Platform), I am studying a master's degree in Data Science at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile. I am looking for a job in topics related to data science and my greatest wish is to be able to contribute significantly to the development of Machine Learning models from data. Some technologies I enjoy working with include Pandas, Seaborn, Python among others.
